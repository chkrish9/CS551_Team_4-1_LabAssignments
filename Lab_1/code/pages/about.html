        <p class="text-justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base used by Google and its
            services to enhance its search engine's results
            with information gathered from a variety of sources. The information is presented to users in an info box
            next to
            the search results. Knowledge Graph info boxes were added to Google's search engine in May 2012, starting in
            the
            United States, with international expansion by the end of the year. The Knowledge Graph was powered in part
            by
            Freebase. The information covered by the Knowledge Graph grew significantly after launch, tripling its
            original size within seven months, and being able to answer "roughly one-third" of the 100 billion monthly
            searches Google processed in May 2016. The information is often used as a spoken answer in Google Assistant
            and
            Google Home searches. The Knowledge Graph has been criticized for providing answers without source
            attribution.
